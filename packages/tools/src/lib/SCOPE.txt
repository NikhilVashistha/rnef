# Query github token

## Now
- User needs to pass `GITHUB_TOKEN` env to the command
- Not recommended or secure
- This occurs at local machine, as on CI fetching remote build is not needed

## Proposed
- [ ] Query user for token if interactive
- [ ] Store token in cache
- [ ] Store token in more secure way if available (macoOS keychain)
